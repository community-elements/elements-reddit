        <description>
            <p class="flavor">A demon rages through the hallways of the Arcane College, tearing students in half as they flee. </p>
            <p>One apprentice stands defiant, placing her fingertips on a jeweled bracelet. With a sudden flash, the girl transforms into a statuesque figure in magnificent white robes.</p>
            <p class="indent">A young squire presents his signet ring to the blackguard. A swirling mist fills the area- and when it clears, a knight in shimmering golden armor stands where the squire was standing. He draws his oversized greatsword, and smirks beneath his armor.</p>
            <p class="indent">Despite the name, Magical Girls are not necessarily female, but the most iconic characters of this class are. Magical Girls are mundane people with the extraordinary ability to transform into a powerful alternate form.</p>
            <h4>KEEPING A PROMISE</h4>
            <p>There are two sources of a Magical Girl's power: a magical promise, and a heirloom given to the character. The Magical Girl makes a promise, and is given the heirloom. The heirloom allows the magical girl to transform.</p>
            <p class="indent">Transformation gives the Magical Girl the power to complete her promise. It is a cyclical relationship that constantly reminds the Magical Girl what she is fighting for.</p>
            <p class="indent">Naturally, the new form provided by the transformation tends to embody the ideals of the promise. The new form may look and act more like the heirloom’s original owner than the Magical Girl using it.</p>
            <h4>THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP</h4>
            <p>A Magical Girl feels empowered by the presence of her friends. These are the ones whom she truly cares about, and may be the reason for her promise.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a Magical Girl is not giving their all in combat to protect their ideals, they are often found engaging in a multitude of light hobbies. From making friendship bracelets, to brewing tea, and napping to their heart's content.</p>
            <p class="indent">Among most groups of friends, disputes are sure to take place over a conflict of priorities. Most Magical Girls strive to serve as an adequate seer to propose a middle ground or compromise to make everyone happy. Magical Girls most often don't have a strong opinion on the sides of these types of disputes and would be most accepting of whichever method their friends would be happiest with. They would rather have everyone get along as a tight-knit family, as opposed to a group of rascals who would be better off separating.</p>
            <p class="indent">An act of true separation from a very close friend, would be heartrendingly painful to a Magical Girl, even to the point where they may lose their own way.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A MAGICAL GIRL</h4>
            <p>As you are creating a Magical Girl, the most important question is “what do you want to transform into?” Is your transformation some kind of beast-like form, a knight in shining armor, or an older, more regal version of your current self? Second, what does your transformation do? Do you rely on martial prowess or magical ability? This should tell you which Magical Promise to make.</p>
            <p class="indent">The next step is to consider who your character made a promise to, as well as why. Is your Magical Promise with a ghost that lives in your Heirloom, an extra-planar being such as an angel, or an ideal? What can you do to fulfill that promise? Once your original goal is completed, how can you continue to uphold the terms of your Magical Promise?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can quickly make a Magical Girl by following these suggestions. Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the Folk Hero background.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 1st level, as a bonus action you may undergo a magical transformation into your alternate form. The transformation generally has a cosmetic change. This could be something minor, such as a difference in hair color, or it could be a major change, such as a new outfit suddenly appearing over your clothing. Transforming requires the magical girl's heirloom. In order to transform, you must be able to take actions, and your heirloom must be on your person. You have two uses of your Transformation at first level, which return after a short or long rest. While you are transformed, you gain the following traits:</p>
			<p>
				<span class="emphasis">Armor Class:</span> While you are transformed and not wearing armor, your armor class is equal to 10 + your Dexterity Modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
				<br/>
				<span class="emphasis">Duration:</span> You can maintain your Transformation for up to one hour. If you are knocked unconscious, your transformation ends early.
				<br/>
				<span class="emphasis">Size:</span> You become a medium humanoid creature, regardless of what your original form was.
				<br/>
				<span class="emphasis">Radiant Weapon:</span>   When you transform, you may choose to summon one or more weapons from the list below. These weapons are made of radiant energy, and shed bright light in a 5-foot radius. Since these weapons are made of light, they deal radiant damage, instead of their normal damage type. These radiant weapons cannot be wielded by anyone other than you, and dissipate as soon as they leave your hand.
				<br/>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<p>Your weapons can be: </p>
				<li>
					<i>(a)</i> Up to two thrown weapons which, if thrown, dissipate and reappear in your hands at the end of your turn;
					<i>(b)</i> Any nonmagical weapon with the ammunition property, which has unlimited ammunition;
					<i>(c)</i> Two light weapons;
					<i>(d)</i> Up to two one-handed weapons, or one-handed weapon and a shield, or;
					<i>(e)</i> A two-handed weapon.
				</li>
				<p>While you are wielding your radiant weapons, you may transform your current weapon (or weapons) into a different option on the list above, or dispel your radiant weapons completely, as a bonus action. If you do not have your radiant weapons in hand, you may use your action to conjure them.</p>
			</ul>

You can dispel them as bonus action and summon them again as action.

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, Magical Girls gain access to a unique form of Spellcasting called Charm Casting, which can only be accessed by their transformed selves.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>Each time you Transform, you gain one spell slot; if you revert back to your normal form, the spell slot is wasted. The level of the spell slot is shown on the Magical Girl table. At 11th level, you gain a second spell slot whenever you Transform.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st level spells of your choice from the magical girl spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Magical Girl table shows when you learn more magical girl spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your magical girl spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a magical girl spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p class="indent">
                      <b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

                      <b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
