			<p>This Domain focuses on the fundamental goodness of art in all its forms from paintings and crafts to poetry and song. There is beauty in art and the protection and curation of that beauty is of paramount importance to the clerics of this Domain.</p>
			<p class="indent">The followers of this Domain are part historians, part curators, and part artists. Where art is persecuted, they protect it. Where art is bidden, they liberate it. Where art is absent, they create it. There is no length these clerics will not go to see that the beauty bestowed on this world is admired and enjoyed.</p>
