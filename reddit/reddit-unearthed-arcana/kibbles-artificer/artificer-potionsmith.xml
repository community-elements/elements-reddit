        <description>
            <p>A potionsmith is an artificer who has pursued the secrets of alchemy. While many a village has an apothecary grinding odd herbs and roots into potent (or not so potent) concoctions, the careful process of mixing and brewing is just one way to achieve results. Through the use of the intricate secrets of the craft and direct infusions using magical rituals, a potionsmith can come up with explosive results in the blink of an eye... sometimes literally.</p>
            <p class="indent">An potionsmith can be a scholar who has delved into of the knowledge the world has to offer or an explorer that has unlocked the secrets of the wilderness. Their knowledge could come from being friends of the fey, or from unfettered access to the royal library. As such, potionsmith’s can be good or evil, lawful or chaotic.</p>

        <description>
            <p>When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with Blowguns, Alchemist’s supplies and Herbalism kit.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your knowledge of alchemy gives you a natural affinity for brewing potions. Creating a potion through normal crafting takes you only half the time and cost it would normally take.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>ALCHEMISTS AND POTIONS</h5>
                <p>Immediately on making a Potionsmith, one may think of the magic potions that exist in most D&amp;D settings, from the simple Healing Potion to the legendary Potion of Storm Giant Strength. However, someone does not need to be a Potionsmith to make these, as crafting rules for them are open to all classes, and best outlined in <em>Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</em>.</p>
                <p class="indent">An alchemist with their proficiency will certainly have the edge in potion crafting, but these potions are not fundamental to the class.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, you’ve acquired a pouch of useful basic reagents, much as a wizard might carry a component pouch. You’ve tucked away things that will come in handy, and can retrieve them as part of using an ability that might require them. As long as you have this pouch on, you use the potionsmith’s features. This pouch is considered as alchemy supplies for the purposes of crafting.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose your reagent pouch, you can spend 50 gold pieces to reacquire the various stocks you need, or spend 1 full day gathering them from a natural environment without expense.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, you know how to get instant reactions to occur without the niceties of grinding, simmering and brewing required for more refined concoctions.</p>
            <p class="indent">Moreover, you know enough ways to do these that with just a few standard supplies, you can get these results out of a wide range of things you can gather in almost any locale and a pinch from your reagent pouch.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can pick three instant reactions from your Upgrade list; these include <b>Alchemical Fire</b>, <b>Alchemical Acid</b>, <b>Healing Draught</b>, <b>Poisonous Gas</b>, or <b>Fortifying Fumes</b>. The reactions you pick do not count against your maximum Upgrades known.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 3rd level, you have found a way to skip most of the brewing process for alchemically creating potent magically effects by directly infusing the potion with your own magic. When you finish a short or long rest and have an empty vial on your person, you may choose one or more the following spells and use a spell slots to cast them.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Infusion Spells</td></tr>

            </table>
            <p>When you cast spells in this way, the spell does not take effect immediately, but is infused into the potion. If the spell grants an effect or restores health, the creature will gain the effect of the spell when the potion is consumed as an action.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the spell has an area of effect, that area of effect takes place when the vial is broken, with the effect centered on where the vial breaks. You can consume the contents of a vial as a bonus action, or, as an action, administer its contents to another creature or throw it up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the spell has a persistent effect that requires concentration, it does not require concentration to maintain, but its duration is shortened to a number of rounds equal to your intelligence modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">A spell that does not require concentration lasts its normal duration. An infused potion loses its potency if it is not used by the end of your next long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can gain additional spells for your Alchemical Infusions through your Alchemist upgrades.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>ON CREATIVITY AND CATAPULTS</h5>
                <p>While as per the feature, you can only accurately <em>throw</em> the vial containing an Infused Potion 30 feet, the trigger merely specifies that the effect takes place where it breaks.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you can find another way to deliver the vial, such as the catapult spell on the artificer spell list... or, well, an actual catapult, you can apply these methods as well.</p>
