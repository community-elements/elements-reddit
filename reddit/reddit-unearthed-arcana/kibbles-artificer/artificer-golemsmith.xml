        <description>
            <p>A Golemsmith is an Artificer that has committed themselves to creating a true work of artifice, forging a golem. A painstaking life ambition, they plan and design meticulously, even if in practice sometimes compromises on materials must be made.</p>
            <p class="indent">Why a Golemsmith embarks on the quest to forge this artificial construct of life can vary. For many it is the pure pursuit of forging the perfect creation, while for others, it is simply so they do not have to carry around their loot, or to have a loyal companion to count on at all times.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Golemsmith is rarely chaotic, as they are people of great care and discipline; those that are not would not have succeeded where they have, but some have been set on their path by such events that might drive them to interact chaotically with society as a whole.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, you forge a mechanical golem to carry out your orders and protect you. The golem is under your control, and understands the languages you speak, but does not speak.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Golem obeys your commands as best it can. On your turn, you can verbally command the construct where to move (no action required by you) and take an action, which requires your action to do. Additionally, you can use your reaction to direct it to take a reaction. The Golem acts on your commands during your turn. If you issue no action command to your Golem, it takes no actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your Golem’s Proficiency increases when yours does. If the golem is killed, it can be returned to life via normal means, such as with the revivify spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, over the course of a long rest, you can repair a slain servant if you have access to its body. It returns to life with half (rounded down) its maximum hit point at the end of the rest during which you repaired it. If the servant is beyond recovery, you can reproduce the construct exactly as it was, with four days of work (eight hours each day) and 100 gp of raw materials.</p>
            <p class="indent">Over the course of a short rest, you can restore hitpoints equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Artificer level to your golem, or repair it to full health during a long rest</p>
            <p class="indent">The base statistics of your golem are as follows:</p>
            <h4>GOLEM</h4>

            <p>When you create your golem, you can add one prefix to its type in the form which basic chassis you use for golem. For example, if you select Warforged, your golem becomes a Warforged Golem, and gains the Warforged modifications to its base statistics.</p>
            <h5>WARFORGED</h5>
            <p>Your golem is roughly humanoid, and comes with the robust flexibility and options that this form provides. Its base strength becomes 16(+3) and it gains proficiency in shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.</p>
            <p class="indent">Its natural weapon is: <em>Slam:</em> +5 (Strength + Proficiency) to hit, reach 5ft., one target. <em>Hit</em> 1d4 + 3 (Strength) bludgeoning damage.</p>
            <h5>QUADRUPEDAL</h5>
            <p>Your golem takes on a quadrupedal design. Larger and more sturdy, it is more suitable to launch into the fray or carry its creator. Its base size becomes large, its base strength and constitution become 16(+3), its natural armor becomes 16, and its speed becomes 35 ft.</p>
            <p class="indent">Its natural weapon is: <em>Bite:</em> +5 (Strength + Proficiency) to hit, reach 5ft., one target. <em>Hit</em> 1d10 + 3 (Strength) piercing damage.</p>
            <h5>WINGED</h5>
            <p>Your Golem is modeled off a flying creature. Smaller and lighter than most golems, it is kept aloft by intricate wings. Its base size becomes small and it gains a flying speed of 30 ft.</p>
            <p class="indent">Its natural weapon is: <em>Talon:</em> +4 (Strength + Proficiency) to hit, reach 5ft., one target. <em>Hit</em> 1d8 + 2 (Strength) slashing damage.</p>
            <h5>LAUNCHER</h5>
            <p>Your Golem becomes akin to a mobile turret, taking the frame of a ballista or other launching device. Its base Dexterity becomes 16(+3) and its speed becomes 25 ft.</p>
            <p class="indent">Its natural weapon is: <em>Shoot:</em> +5 (Dexterity + Proficiency) to hit, reach 60/240ft., one target. <em>Hit</em> 1d10 + 3 (Dexterity) piercing damage.</p>
            <h5>SPECIALIZED</h5>
            <p>Your Golem defies all expectations, its design fueled by your own rampant creativity. A little less robust and stable, it is far more extensible to your visionary plans. Your Golem starts with the basic statistics, but you can select 2 free upgrades that do not count against your upgrade total.</p>
            <p class="indent">Its natural weapon is: <em>Slam:</em> +4 (Strength + Proficiency) to hit, reach 5ft., one target. <em>Hit</em> 1d8 + 4 (Strength) bludgeoning damage.</p>
