            <p>As a half-azer, you are locked in a constant struggle between worlds-that of your ancient dwarven liniage, and that of your relentless elemental cousins.</p>
            <p>While it is true that youre brethren, the Azers, are beings of pure fire-crafted not born-you belong to a rare linn of dwarves who escaped the bonds of slavery before their blazing corruption by their fire giant and titan captors could be fully realised.</p>
            <p>When you are angry, your hair becomes hot to the touch, and in sunlight, your skin shines witha brassy glow, often leading you to be ostracized by you're dwarven relatives. Even still, your natural affinity for fire drives you to a life of adventure as you fight with the flaming intensity of an inferno.</p>

            <p>As a tundra dwarf, you are acclimated to the harsh realities of a cold world, both in temperature and in regards to isolation from others.  Generations spent steeping in mystical polar energies has granted your people an innate affinity for the arcane.  The arctic dwarves of Faerun are tundra dwarves, as are the Vrakar from the Icereach region in the Dragonlance setting</p>
